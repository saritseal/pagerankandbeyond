1. Linear Classification
	>This is the first task in the context of Machine learning. The task is to classify or group the data points into groups and identify a line to seperate these data points.
	The job is to identify the features that will help us classify the data into groups. Lets take an example of data points with two features each data point is identified 
	by two features. This gives us a two dimensional space. Let us consider the point **x**<sub>j</sub> for the j<sup>th</sup> element in the data-set.
	In building mathematical models for classifying we are going to focus on dividing these points with a straight line. This is called Linear classification
	 Naive Bayes and Rocchio are examples of Linear classifier
